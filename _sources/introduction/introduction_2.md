# Introduction II

This week, while I'm away on a conference in Italy, I want you to explore the basics of Jupyter Notebooks. Don't worry, you won't have to program anything by yourself at this point. I just want you to familiarize yourself with the application so that next time, we can dive right into our first Python programming session! We will also do a more in depth introduction to jupyter notebooks next week.
All I want you to do for today, is work through this page, look at the screenshots and follow along by yourself. If you run into any issues, we will discuss them the week after when I'm back! Good luck and have fun!

## Open jupyter notebook

There are different ways to open the program. If you installed Anaconda, you can open the `Anaconda Navigator` and from your `base` envirnoment, jupyter notebooks should have already been installed. Just click on `Launch` and youre ready to go!

If you installed miniconda, you won't have the `Navigagor`. Instead, what you should do, is open your `Terminal` and type in `jupyter notebook`. Make sure your `base` environment is activated.
