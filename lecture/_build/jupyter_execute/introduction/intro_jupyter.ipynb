The `currently selected cell` is indicated with a `grey` or `green border depending` on whether the `notebook` is in `edit or command mode`. Clicking inside a `cell`'s `editor area` will enter `edit mode`. Clicking on the `prompt` or the `output area` of a `cell` will enter `command mode`.\n",

For example, to `run` the `code in a cell`, select it and then click the  `Run button` in the `toolbar` or the `Cell` -> `Run` menu item. Similarly, to `copy` a `cell`, select it and then click the `copy selected cells  button` in the `toolbar` or the `Edit` -> `Copy` menu item.

To `render` the `selected cell` with the `mouse`, click the  `button` in the `toolbar` or the `Cell` -> `Run` menu item. To `unrender` the `selected cell`, `double click` on the `cell`."
